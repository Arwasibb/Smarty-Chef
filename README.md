# Smarty Kitchen Game Overview
Smarty Kitchen Game is an interactive educational game with multiple stages, designed to enhance problem-solving and critical thinking in a fun and engaging way. In the first stage, players are challenged to decode the ingredients, where each ingredient is represented by a unique code. The player must match each code to the correct item using observation and trial-error.
Once the ingredient decoding phase is completed, the player proceeds to the cooking stage, which features a timer-based mini-game. In this stage, a timer simulates the oven cooking process, and players must monitor it carefully to "cook" the meal at the right time.

The game is ideal for kids and beginners, combining learning and entertainment through a visually appealing and easy-to-use interface.
